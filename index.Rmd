# Predicting Survival and Controlling for Biased with Random Survival Forests and Condtional Inference Forests Using Right-Censored Data

## What is Survival Analysis?

The main goal of survival analysis is to analyze and estimate the expected amount of time until an event of interest occurs for a subject or groups of subjects. Originally, survival analysis was developed for the primary use of measuring the lifespans of certain populations. However, over time its utilities have extended to a wide array of applications even outside of the domain of healthcare. Thus, while biological death continues to be the main outcome under the scrutiny of survival analysis, other outcomes of interest may include time to mechanical failure, time to repeat offense of a released inmate, time to the split of a financial stock and more! Time in survival analysis is relative and all subjects of interest are likened to a common starting point at baseline (t = 0) with a 100% probability of not experiencing the event of interest.

Subjects are observed from baseline to some often pre-specified time at the end of study. Thus, not every subject will experience the event of interest within the observational period's time frame. In this case, we don't know if or when these subjects will experience the event, we just know that they have not experienced it during the study period. This is called censoring, more specifically, right-censoring. Right censoring is just one of multiple forms of censoring that survival data strives to adjust for. Dropout is only a form of right censoring.

### PBC Data

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is an autoimmune disease leading to destruction of the small bile ducts in the liver. Progression is slow but inexorable, eventually leading to cirrhosis and liver decompensation.

This data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in PBC conducted between 1974 and 1984. A total of 424 PBC patients met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. This dataset tracks survival status until end up follow up period as well as contains many covariates collected during the clinical trial.
