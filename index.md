# Predicting Survival and Controlling for Biased with Random Survival Forests and Condtional Inference Forests Using Right-Censored Data

## What is Survival Analysis?

The main goal of survival analysis is to analyze and estimate the
expected amount of time until an event of interest occurs for a subject
or groups of subjects. Originally, survival analysis was developed for
the primary use of measuring the lifespans of certain populations.
However, over time its utilities have extended to a wide array of
applications even outside of the domain of healthcare. Thus, while
biological death continues to be the main outcome under the scrutiny of
survival analysis, other outcomes of interest may include time to
mechanical failure, time to repeat offense of a released inmate, time to
the split of a financial stock and more! Time in survival analysis is
relative and all subjects of interest are likened to a common starting
point at baseline (t = 0) with a 100% probability of not experiencing
the event of interest.

Subjects are observed from baseline to some often pre-specified time at
the end of study. Thus, not every subject will experience the event of
interest within the observational period’s time frame. In this case, we
don’t know if or when these subjects will experience the event, we just
know that they have not experienced it during the study period. This is
called **censoring**, more specifically, right-censoring. Right
censoring is just one of multiple forms of censoring that survival data
strives to adjust for. Dropout is only a form of right censoring.

## Applications

### PBC Data

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is an autoimmune disease leading to
destruction of the small bile ducts in the liver. Progression is slow
but inexorable, eventually leading to cirrhosis and liver
decompensation.

This data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in PBC conducted between 1974
and 1984. A total of 424 PBC patients met eligibility criteria for the
randomized placebo controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. This
dataset tracks survival status until end up follow up period as well as
contains many covariates collected during the clinical trial.

### Employee Turnover Data

A dataset found on Kaggle containing the employee attrition information
of 1,129 employees and information about time to turnover, their gender,
age, industry, profession, employee pipeline information, the presence
of a coach on probation, the gender of their supervisor, and wage
information.
